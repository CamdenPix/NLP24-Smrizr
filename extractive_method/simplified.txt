interviews auman acknowledged that she had steered jaehnig car while he shot at police she also denied ever intending to burglarize cheever although she did admit that when asked by her companions about cheever possessions the previous night she had mentioned two large speakers he owned two days later the officers involved in auman arrest would provide additional statements that differed from their initial reports officers jason brake and marc bennett had initially reported that auman had immediately stepped out of the alcove she was found in with her hands raised in their second statement the officers instead stated auman leaned down to the right as if to drop something before raising her hands which the officers interpreted as her possibly dropping or transferring jaehnig gun in later interview auman denied this occurred and stated she never held jaehnig weapon auman trial began on july the district attorney had previously offered plea deal in which auman would have pleaded guilty to assaulting police officer when she steered jaehnig car while he fired at pursuing officers in exchange auman would have received year prison sentence auman declined the deal auman and her family were unable to afford private legal representation citing quotes for retainer fees at around so auman was represented by the colorado public defender office the prosecution was led by colorado deputy district attorney tim twining auman charges included first degree murder first degree burglary first degree assault and menacing twining legal strategy centered around the felony murder rule law stating that defendant accused of certain predicate felonies may also be charged with murder if the act of the committing the felony resulted in someone deatheven if the accused person did not personally intend or cause the death in colorado burglary is one of these predicate felonies therefore auman charge for second degree burglary also allowed her to be charged with murder even though she had already been detained at the time jaehnig fatally shot vanderjagt auman trial lasted days after several hours of deliberation the jury found auman guilty of first degree murder second degree burglary menacing and conspiracy to commit first degree burglary she was subsequently sentenced to life in prison without parole auman was ultimately placed in the women correctional facility in cañon city colorado auman companions at the buffalo creek lodge steven duprey dion gerze and deme soriano were separately charged only with burglary and each took plea deal duprey received four years in prison gerze and soriano each received two years of probation public response auman family began attempts at public outreach following her conviction with her stepfather creating website lisl com in order to collect information about her legal case and to attract interest initial coverage was primarily within denver media focusing on the harshness of her sentence at the time of auman sentencing life imprisonment was mandatory for felony murder and the perceived incongruity of auman conviction for murder despite the uncontested fact that she was detained in police custody while separate person committed the murder under the felony murder rule in january auman wrote brief letter from prison to hunter thompson in which she expressed her appreciation for his novel fear and loathing in las vegas complained that the colorado department of corrections had banned his books and briefly summarized her case thompson wrote back that he had heard of her situation and would consider writing about her his subsequent publications about auman and his personal efforts at advocacy and organization on her behalf would attract national attention towards auman case and the felony murder rule soon after receiving auman letter thompson hosted gathering of criminal defense lawyers visiting aspen for national association of criminal defense lawyers nacdl conference to watch the super bowl during the game thompson discussed auman case resulting in the nacdl involvement in the case and the creation of legal defense fund matt moseley communications director for the colorado senate democratic party suggested that thompson hold public event supporting auman on may thompson did so holding rally at the colorado state capital with speakers including musician warren zevon pitkin county sheriff bob braudis past president of the nacdl gerry goldstein and moseley the rally was timed to coincide with the filing of an appeal on auman behalf by colorado public defender kathleen lord and an amicus brief filing by the nacdl appeals and re sentencing colorado public defender kathleen lord appealed auman conviction in may lord arguments included that auman was no longer in immediate flight once she had been detained by police and that her arrest terminated her liability for murder the colorado colorado court of appeals disagreed in september affirming auman initial convictions lord next appealed to the colorado supreme court in their response in march the supreme court maintained that auman liability for murder did not terminate upon her arrest however they agreed with lord argument that the instructions given to the jury regarding her burglary charge were faulty as they did not specify that auman must have acted knowingly in taking cheever property when she entered his room as auman had stated she did not intend to steal cheever property and that she did not personally take any of his items the court felt the jury could have been misled by their improper instructions the court therefore reversed both auman burglary and murder convictions as her conviction for murder was predicated on her burglary conviction calling for new trial in july auman accepted plea deal in which she pleaded guilty to burglary and accessory to first degree murder avoiding re trial auman was re sentenced to years of community corrections and discharged from prison into halfway house in october she was released from her halfway house in april under the restrictions that she remain in the denver area and submit to close supervision for another eight years see

cathedral of the transfiguration is an orthodox cathedral in lublin and the main church of the of the polish orthodox church it also serves as the seat of the lublin in the the cathedral is located on ruska street the currently existing building was constructed between and on the site of two older churches it was dedicated in by metropolitan petro mohyla of kyiv during construction and for several decades afterwards the church ownership was fiercely contested between the orthodox and the uniates who finally took permanent control of the building in the lublin parish returned to the orthodox church in following the abolition of the uniate eparchy of chełm by the tsarist administration and military the cathedral is particularly revered for housing copies of the and icons of the mother of god the temple was registered as historical monument on january and february under number history first orthodox churches in lublin historical sources do not definitively indicate when the first orthodox church in lublin was established in the chronicle of wincenty kadłubek there is mention of lublin being taken over by daniel of galicia who supposedly built castle and an orthodox church there however some historians question daniel presence in lublin document from references the murder of two women from kolechowice on their way to the schismatic feast of the savior the orthodox feast of the transfiguration in lublin this suggests the existence of well known church in the city dedicated to this feast the authenticity of this document is also disputed historians and mikołaj roszczenko emphasize that the orthodox established in would not have been created without an existing network of orthodox parishes in the region in uniate bishop of chełm claimed without citing his sources that the church of the savior the transfiguration of jesus at słomiany market was founded by princess maria ivanovna of kyiv in according to kuprianowicz and roszczenko the church must have existed earlier as preserved text of donation by jurij czartoryjski refers to the church as founded and built in ancient times krzysztof grzesiak generally states that the oldest orthodox church in lublin located where the current cathedral stands was built in the th century there is no doubt about the existence of an orthodox parish in lublin in the th century which used the church located at the site of the current cathedral the temple chronicle also mentions the construction of an orthodox monastery near the church between and orthodox uniate conflict over the church in lublin view of the cathedral from general view of the cathedral in church brotherhood was established at the parish of the transfiguration in lublin with saint onuphrius as its patron the brotherhood included members from prominent orthodox families in the polish lithuanian commonwealth and its foundation was endorsed by the patriarch of antioch year later the brotherhood began constructing new church after the previous one burned down salvaging only the iconostasis the exact date of the new church completion is unclear but it was likely dedicated in the early th century however the structure deteriorated prompting the brotherhood to start building another this time masonry church in the construction took years likely due to the ongoing conflict between the orthodox brotherhood and the uniate hierarchy as the bishop of chełm dionysius supported the union of brest in theoretically converting the entire diocese to the eastern catholic church the ownership of the church of the transfiguration was contentious issue leading to several court cases in the lublin tribunal the orthodox side was represented by the brotherhood supported by the orthodox metropolitan of kyiv job and the orthodox bishop of chełm in the newly elected king of poland władysław iv vasa legalized the functioning of the orthodox church in the country and confirmed several rights for its followers including two decrees concerning the church in lublin the king pledged personal protection over the orthodox church and agreed to exclude it from the jurisdiction of the uniate bishops of chełm that same year metropolitan petro mohyla of kyiv dedicated the church on march during journey from kraków to kyiv despite the king declarations the uniates forcibly took control of the church and its associated monastery in takeover that was legalized by new royal decree in protests by orthodox nobles at regional assemblies led the king to order the return of the church to the orthodox brotherhood in which was implemented the following year however in the church was once again under uniate control the church was supposed to be returned to the orthodox following the treaty of zboriv in but was again taken over by the uniates in the church finally returned to orthodox hands after the treaty of hadiach but the orthodox presence in lublin dwindled due to the polonization of the local ruthenian nobility the number of brotherhood members and their influence declined leading to the parish and monastery in lublin formally joining the union in the few remaining orthodox believers attended the church of st josaphat built in for the greek merchant community the appearance of the church of the transfiguration in lublin along with the dormition church in lviv served as inspiration for the builders of the lutsk orthodox fellowship of the true cross uniate church after the final takeover by the uniates the church of the transfiguration in lublin retained its status as parish church and the associated monastery became part of the basilian order during this period significant changes were made to the church interior reflecting the latinization and polonization trends within the uniate church new elements such as organs and bells were introduced side altars were installed and sermons were delivered in polish reoccupation of the church by the orthodox copy of the jerusalem icon of the mother of god after as part of preparations to dissolve the uniate chełm eparchy which was part of the repressions following the suppression of the january uprising the tsarist authorities allowed uniate clergy from galicia who were participants in the ritualistic movement and sympathizers of the russophile movement to take up pastoral work in the diocese their mission was to gradually remove latin elements from uniate rituals and churches to facilitate the eventual conversion of the uniates to orthodoxy the lublin parish was taken over by priest from near lviv father mikołaj kolenkowski during his tenure the church underwent renovations to remove distinctly latin elements he also gradually introduced rituals similar to those used in the russian orthodox church the final dissolution of the union in lublin occurred on may at that time the reestablished orthodox parish had members primarily russian immigrants few years later after the construction of the in lublin the lublin governor suggested the dissolution of the parish but this was opposed by bishop of lublin new orthodox brotherhood of the transfiguration was established at the church in comprehensive renovation of the building was carried out funded by tsar alexander ii removing the last elements foreign to the tradition of the russian orthodox church during the renovation the design was somewhat carelessly based on patterns from konstantin thon projects of churches in subsequent decades until the russians withdrew from lublin the church received gifts from patriarch damian of jerusalem and metropolitan of kyiv the first of these hierarchs presented the church of the transfiguration with copy of the along with fragment of the true cross placed at the church of the holy sepulchre at the beginning of the th century despite the renovations carried out few years earlier the church was in such poor condition that new renovation was necessary at the initiative of bishop of warsaw heaters were installed the floor was replaced the iconostasis was gilded and the exterior stucco was restored and embellished in the russian population of lublin embarked on mass immigration those leaving the city took with them the church miraculous icons gospel book eight bells and part of the furnishings these were moved to the chudov monastery in moscow and after the monastery was destroyed in the late they were lost without trace interwar period and world war ii the first orthodox priest returned to lublin in allowing the reactivation of the parish of the transfiguration in the early years following poland regained independence orthodox christians lost nearly all of their churches in lublin except for the church of the transfiguration and the cemetery the polish city administration even considered dissolving the parish of the transfiguration and turning the church into branch of the parish in chełm another proposed solution was to close the parish while keeping the church itself available for an orthodox military chaplain ultimately these plans were abandoned and the lublin parish resumed operations within the chełm deanery of the the parish remained active throughout the interwar period in it had members mid decade estimates by the catholic diocese of lublin suggested higher number of the parish relatively small size compared to other orthodox parishes in the lublin land only the lublin parish had fewer than members led to another consideration in transferring the church to military chaplain with civil registry duties being assigned to the parish in dratów this plan received approval from the chief orthodox chaplain of the polish army father colonel however the lublin parish continued to operate within the chełm deanery of the by the parish had approximately members including notable group of ukrainian emigrants and former soldiers of the ukrainian people republic as well as russians who had stayed in lublin after and declared polish nationality to retain their government jobs during world war ii the parish operated within the of the orthodox church in the general government until the church main dome was damaged during the war lublin icon of the mother of god following the expulsion of ukrainians from poland to the soviet union between and which led to the closure of over parishes of the polish orthodox church in the lublin and chełm lands due to lack of faithful the church in lublin was one of six churches in the region alongside churches in chełm włodawa hrubieszów biała podlaska and the monastery in jabłeczna that were allowed to remain open this decision made at the request of bishop timothy of lublin was justified by the need to meet the religious needs of polish orthodox christians after world war ii in october the church reopened to the faithful after the arrival of father in lublin under his initiative the parish undertook the restoration of the damaged church with partial funding provided by the ministry of reconstruction and contributions from the faithful of the białystok diocese who donated over pln thanks to father baranow efforts the polish orthodox church confirmed its ownership rights to the church of the transfiguration between and the church iconostasis was renovated previously in the the church had been robbed losing several icons some of which dated back to the th century archbishop abel the first ordinary of the diocese of lublin and chełm in the cathedral in lublin in the diocese of lublin and chełm was established intended by the polish orthodox church episcopate to continue the traditions of the pre union of brest chełm eparchy and the chełm eparchy of the moscow patriarchate archbishop abel popławski became the bishop of the new diocese with the church of the

tower the exterior of the building is decorated sparingly with only the main nave featuring more pronounced decorative gable with baroque volutes the cathedral is crowned by single dome with russian orthodox cross according to piotr krasny the appearance and layout of the church modify the traditional russian cross domed church model towards three bay hall church with four corner turrets the structure is built on rectangular plan within its perimeter walls four pillars define bay giving the interior centralizing character that may suggest cross plan however krasny notes that person

with frieze the church pastophoria are topped with stepped gables and pinnacles in the form of obelisks iconostasis interior of the cathedral the iconostasis located in the cathedral was created at the beginning of the th century during the construction of the brick church of the transfiguration on the site of the destroyed wooden one however for its construction in addition to th century images

to have died many of whom were buried in unmarked or marked graves background american indian boarding schools were established in the united states from the mid th to the early th centuries with primary objective of civilizing or assimilating native american children and youth into anglo american culture in the process these schools denigrated native american culture and made children give up their languages and religion they took classes on how to conduct manual labor which included farming housekeeping brick making and railroad work when not in class they were expected to maintain upkeep of the schools unclean and overpopulated living conditions led to the spread of disease and many students did not receive enough food bounties were offered for students who tried to run away and many students committed suicide students who died were sometimes placed in coffins and buried in the school cemetery by their own classmates the schools were usually harsh especially for younger children who had been forcibly separated from their families and forced to abandon their native american identities and cultures children sometimes died in the school system due to infectious disease

additional reasons for unaccounted deaths or gravesites included unrecorded deaths outside of the period deaths from non federally funded schools deaths in institutions without public records and deaths in assimilatory institutions that were not schools including asylums day schools orphanages and dormitories deb haaland characterized the boarding school system as concerted attempt to eradicate the indian problem through assimilation or outright wiping out native american culture while expressing personal remorse haaland suggested that the united states federal government needed to make formal apology on behalf of the abuse death and trauma caused by the school system the department of the interior recommended compensation for the native american communities with government

special forces commander elvis new main character for the series elvis was billed by the bbc as cheeky chappy londoner who is fearless impulsive self confident determined and cool under pressure pasqualino was drawn to the role as he was attracted to elvis character and the themes of the series to prepare for the role pasqualino watched documentaries about life in the special forces he commented that he did so to get into the heads of sas members task which he admittedly found difficult as they never show much emotion pasqualino described elvis as man with lot of bravado lot of

the aims and objectives of his work in an interview with what on tv pasqualino billed elvis as an alpha male and as special forces commander slightly more hardened than the characters of section pasqualino didn have much time to prepare to play elvis as he finished job in sri lanka mere hours before our girl began preparing its actors physically speaking of boot camp training for the series the actor compared it to the preparation he underwent to play artagnan in the musketeers as both included many drills handling of weapons and nonverbal hand signals this previous role also helped when it came to filming as pasqualino had become used to wearing heavy costumes in intense heat however he admitted that due to the heightened physicality of our girl the heat eventually began to take toll he noted difference being the type of combat as there was less hand to hand combat involved in our girl he concluded it wasn easier or harder just different pasqualino admitted that he enjoyed handling guns on set commenting that you feel like lad when doing so pasqualino also voiced delight in filming in cape town south africa recounting that the actors were often allowed to explore and

determined to make amends and win her affection back when asked about his character connection to georgie pasqualino stated his character found her absolutely beautiful and enjoyed the challenge of being in romantic relationship with her as she doesn fall at his feet his character soft spot for georgie prompted pasqualino to label her as elvis weakness after it was announced that our girl had been greenlit for third series and pasqualino would reprise his role as elvis the actor predicted that audiences would be surprised with the state of elvis and georgie relationship in the series keegan had previously expressed that georgie would still believe they can be together when pasqualino added that elvis would want to reconcile with her as he was head over heels in love with her pasqualino commitments to his role as albert hill on snatch dictated that elvis be written out of our girl after four episodes of series three pasqualino helped series creator tony grounds come up with potential reasons for elvis departure with the actor being the one to suggest his character be killed off in dramatic fashion before grounds accepted the idea after deciding elvis would be killed the two decided that for his demise to have an emotional punch elvis would propose to georgie shortly beforehand grounds came to the decision that elvis would die in battle fate which he felt was fitting end to the character as he quite close to death all the time due to his job he deemed other potential explanations for elvis absence as daft and felt his death was necessary as maintaining the drama of the show would not have been possible if elvis and georgie had lived happily ever after and didn want the relationship narrative to become repetitive pasqualino admitted he was shocked to learn how elvis would die but supported the decision arguing it needed to be quite horrific for it to land pasqualino expressed hopes that elvis wouldn be forgotten by fans after his death reception

to magical person finds the talking horse and discovers his benefactor true evil nature and acquires golden colour on some part of his body second narrative subtype found in greece turkey caucasus uzbekistan and northern india where the protagonist is born through the use of magical fruit and third one subtype according to toelken this subtype is the oldest being found in southern siberia iran the arabian countries mediterranean hungary and poland in this subtype the hero who may be prince and the foal are born at the same time and become friends but their lives are at stake when the hero

balkans the caucasus the near east and central asia according to turkologist types atu and atu contain this motif the princess chooses her own husband of lowly appearance in gathering of potential suitors by giving him an object an apple however he also remarks that the motif is spread in folk literature and may appear in other tale types germanist in enzyklopädie des märchens argued that

from july to august far right anti immigration protests and riots occurred in england and northern ireland within the united kingdom this followed mass stabbing in southport on july in which three children were killed the riots were fuelled by false claims circulated by far right groups that the perpetrator of the attack was muslim and an asylum seeker in addition to broader islamophobic racist and anti immigrant sentiments that had grown leading up to the protests the disorder included racist attacks arson and looting and was the largest incident of social unrest in england since arrests and nearly charges had been made in relation to the unrest as of september many rioters had already been sentenced and imprisoned many for two to three years up to nine year sentence for arson with intent to endanger life the riots began in southport just few streets away from where the attack took place demonstration outside the southport mosque quickly turned violent and protesters attacked police officers injuring over fifty burned police van and attacked the mosque over the following days the unrest spread to other towns and cities in england and to belfast in northern ireland on july over protesters were arrested in london and demonstrations occurred in manchester hartlepool and aldershot on august rioting took place in sunderland where citizens advice bureau was set on fire and police officers were injured and several people were arrested the most severe rioting took place over the weekend of august when anti immigration protesters clashed with police and counter protesters attacked homes and businesses owned by immigrants and attacked hotels housing asylum seekers from august the unrest began to abate counter protests consistently and considerably outnumbered far right protesters and were followed by large anti racist rallies across the country on august the riots had limited formal organisation instead rioters assembled around individual far right social media personalities with the aid of far right telegram group chats affiliated with active club england the terrorgram network and football hooliganism firms groups involved in the riots included supporters of the defunct islamophobic group english defence league edl including its former leader tommy robinson members of the neo nazi hate group patriotic alternative the neo nazi organisation british movement the far right political party national front and the fascist political party britain first rioters clashed with local muslims and counter protesters who were mobilised by stand up to racism and other anti fascist and anti racist groups overview background on july knife attack took place at taylor swift themed children yoga and dance workshop three children were killed and eight other children were injured with five of them in critical condition two adults at the event were also critically injured when the prime minister of the united kingdom keir starmer laid flowers in southport the following day he was met with hostile shouts from some of the public with one asking how many more starmer when are you going to do something following the stabbing there was incorrect speculation online about the name of the suspected attacker misinformation and disinformation including false claims about the suspect identity nationality religion and immigration status were circulated on social media by high profile far right accounts including by tommy robinson far right activist who founded the now disbanded anti islam english defence league edl in the false claim that the perpetrator was named ali al shakati is believed to have originated from the formerly twitter account of an anti lockdown campaigner and gained greater audience when repeated by the website channel now website known for spreading fake news russia was accused of being behind deliberate disinformation campaign and as of august the national crime agency and department for science innovation and technology are investigating such claims newly created southport themed telegram group became inundated with misinformation including from the far right national front prior to dissemination on social media platforms the institute for strategic dialogue stated that the now deleted southport wake up group with members on telegram became integral in organising and promoting the subsequent riots and inciting hatred and violence disinformation was also spread on social media by the neo nazi group british movement and accelerationist telegram channels with links to the proscribed terror groups atomwaffen division and national action were used to co ordinate and organise the riots merseyside police attempted to quell speculation by confirming that the name being circulated was not connected to the case and was not the suspect the police initially released the information that the suspect was male aged seventeen from banks in lancashire though born in cardiff it was later reported that the suspect was british citizen born to rwandan parents that he had moved to the southport area in and that he had no known links to islam the spread of misinformation has widely been given as the cause of the southport riots during the protests widespread disinformation blaming immigrants and muslims for crime were shared online andrew chadwick professor of political communication at loughborough university described viral tweet as being deliberately fabricated to generate hostility toward ethnic minorities and immigrants and it potentially islamophobic piece of propaganda matthew feldman an expert on right wing extremism commented it is difficult to think of much better example of online harms breaching the real world than fake story demonising muslims and people of colour and leading to riots on the streets former security minister stephen mcpartland accused russia and vladimir putin regime of involvement in the campaign of misinformation describing it as part of the russian playbook days later the independent reported that misinformation and conspiracy regarding the suspect remained and appeared to be the motivating force behind the protests in separate event woman was stabbed in stirling on august tommy robinson falsely claimed on social media that an alleged muslim had been involved in an incident in which three women had been stabbed other accounts spread the misinformation contributing to tensions man was arrested by the police who described him as white and local to the area the release of these details was unusual and done to curb misinformation nick lowles the head of anti racism charity hope not hate also apologised after falsely claiming separate far right acid attack on muslim woman analysis for the southport riot far right activists had been promoting the demonstration that started in southport prior to involvement in the riot huffpost described far right activists as having hijacked the vigil for the victims and the manchester evening news reported far right thugs fuelled by lies sought to exploit the tragedy merseyside police said on the night of the riot that they believed supporters of the edl were involved in and organised the disturbances hope not hate described them as supporters of tommy robinson robinson denied the edl were involved while arguing that the anger in southport was justified prominent member of the neo nazi group patriotic alternative took part in the riot and another member helped to promote the event the protests and riots were fuelled by wider islamophobia concerns over crime anti migration sentiment xenophobia nationalism and against perceived biases by the police and media the independent described the riots as being sparked by islamophobic and racist sentiments with examples of mosques being targeted and several violent racist attacks on ethnic minorities by the far right in liverpool hull and bristol politico described the cause of the violence as islamophobic resentment that had long brewed across the united kingdom as having surfaced citing hate crimes associated with british muslims as being the highest among any religious group in the country according to government data according to hope not hate although the stabbing in southport was the catalyst most of these protests and riots are more broadly focused expressive of wider hostility to anti muslim and anti migrant prejudice as well as visceral streak of populist anti government sentiment extremism experts attributed the large far right rally in london led by robinson week prior to the protests as having boosted supporters with robinson playing significant role in inciting outrage the financial times described the evolution of the movement from more formally organised white supremacist groups into personality driven splinter groups while capitalising on social media for outreach and organising police officials have described organisers as being in distinct far right groups organising online under banners such as enough is enough save our kids and stop the boats the latter in reference to migrant crossings of the english channel with robinson being central figure in calls to hold riots writing for the observer shabana mahmood the secretary of state for justice suggested the impact of the disorder would be felt for months and years to come as the volume of cases linked to the riots going through the courts would affect government plans to address backlog of cases timeline july southport mosque location of the first riot at approximately bst hundreds of protesters gathered outside southport mosque chanting no surrender and english till die within several minutes protesters clashed with police protesters barricaded themselves and shouted tommy robinson far right activist who founded the edl robinson had been arrested and then released two days prior before he fled the country failing to appear at high court hearing to which he had been

cheaper rural one through the more sparsely populated interior with the inland route entailing backtracking to fortaleza first complete lack of foreign exchange bureaux in aracati forced kelly jeremy to wait seven hours for bus they could afford with their remaining brazilian reals this unanticipated turn of events allowed scott sam to catch up to the leading pair but they also found themselves without enough local currency to pay for bus tickets some helpful mormon missionaries facilitated an impromptu exchange and so scott sam managed to secure seats for themselves on the same midnight service to natal as the leading team jeff freddy the only team to opt to make their way through the interior headed first to quixadá where they worked alongside alpacas at glamping site in the caatinga after which they left for juazeiro do norte on an overnight bus there they visited the monumental statue of the city patron saint padre cícero romão batista before pressing onward to brejo

where they had arranged to top up funds working in local restaurant the next day scott sam caught nightbus to feira de santana meanwhile kelly jeremy had journeyed down the brazilian coast to maceió leapfrogging their rivals and were also heading to feira de santana when kola mary ellen found out the bus from petrolândia to lençóis was sold out they caught lucky break when they were offered taxi at the same price as the cost of the bus tickets on day jeff freddy were the first team to arrive in the colonial mining town of lençóis they were first directed to the church of igreja do rosario and

seguro to work as waiter and an axé dancer respectively at famous beach bar that same day kelly jeremy also departed checkpoint two but chose to travel via seabra to the capital brasília where they arrived on day whilst in the city they visited the oscar niemeyer designed metropolitan cathedral before trying their hand at shoe shining at the intercity bus terminal last to depart scott sam took chance and requisitioned taxi to itaberaba away for an opportunity to top up their funds but having underestimated the journey time arrived too late both for work and any onward travel determined to turn their fortunes around they managed to secure job that evening in the kitchen of pizzeria having made it to rio de janeiro via vitoria freddy took the opportunity to sell mate cocido on copacabana

if any to traverse to reach argentina for jeff freddy the choice of route via paraguay was determined by work opportunity at camp site just outside the brazilian city of cascavel although first to depart the checkpoint they just missed bus to cascavel and had to wait another six hours for the next service kelly jeremy made the decision to cross into argentina directly from brazil at foz do iguaçu whilst there they took the opportunity to see iguazu falls before crossing the border most likely via the fraternity bridge into argentina at puerto iguazú scott sam selected route that would take them through relatively expensive uruguay in the hope that they could command higher wages for any work they did there initially they travelled by train on the serra verde express to curitiba in the state of paraná and then took long distance bus to the uruguayan capital of montevideo kola mary ellen wanted to attend saint patrick day festival to celebrate their irish roots in the brazilian city of porto alegre which also dictated that they use uruguay as stepping stone to argentina the bus to porto alegre broke down en route and the pair missed the celebrations but worse was yet to come having successfully taken bus to punta del este in uruguay for budget boosting job kola realized he had left his passport on board without it he and mary ellen would not be able to cross the border into argentina and their race would effectively be over disheartened the pair pressed ahead to their job in vineyard where much to the relief of kola learned the passport was with lost property in montevideo jeff freddy crossed the friendship bridge from brazil into ciudad del este paraguay and then caught bus to the paraguay argentina border at encarnación where they took the posadas encarnación international train across the san roque gonzález de santa cruz bridge to posados in argentina and then an onward bus direct to tigre in the parana river delta already in argentina kelly jeremy took bus to concordia where they planned day of sightseeing and tango dancing scott sam entered argentina via very expensive ferry across the river plate from montevideo to buenos aires but not before working in an asado restaurant to recoup some funds meanwhile kola mary ellen took much cheaper overnight bus between the two capital cities arriving into tigre on day the teams were initially instructed to take water taxi towards the museum of art and then commandeer it onto the delta eco hotel scott sam arrived first with kelly jeremy arriving almost hours later they were followed by kola

they spotted job opportunity near córdoba at vineyard in the town of villa giardino and made their way there as it promised both good pay and free bed board the third and fourth placed teams avoided the capital and found themselves making nearby el talar their first port of call kola mary ellen desperately short of funds pressed onward to gaucho country and the town of esquina to work with the livestock on ranch and tried their hand at sheep shearing and horse riding whilst at the ranch kola reflected on the death of his father from dementia when jeff freddy left at almost midnight on day they had few transport options so they caught taxi to el talar and managed to find seats on an overnight bus to córdoba from there they took another bus to san josé de las salinas where they secured bed for the night in hotel near the salinas grandes salt flats in return for housekeeping shift in empedrado scott sam undertook shift washing cars and were rewarded with buggy ride amongst the dunes along the paraná river stranded in the small town their meagre earnings were wiped out by the cost of hotel room for the night the next day they caught bus to corrientes city which kola mary ellen were also headed towards the two teams crossed paths at the bus station with no direct buses from corrientes to tilcara both teams caught bus to salta and then took taxi to tilcara jeff freddy gambled on taxi from san josé de las salinas to remote town called frías as they were reluctant to backtrack all the way to córdoba whilst kelly jeremy chose the opposite approach and headed back to the transport hub of córdoba when they had finished at the vineyard with very limited options in frías jeff freddy caught another northbound bus that only took them as far as san miguel de tucumán in córdoba with six hours to kill kelly jeremy took the time to visit the cathedral before catching an overnight bus to the city of san salvador de jujuy by the time jeff freddy reached san miguel de tucumán they had managed to secure tickets onwards to the same city thanks to fellow passenger at the bus station the two teams missed each other by matter of minutes jeff freddy made it onto an onward bus whilst kelly jeremy chose to take taxi instead of waiting for the next service after travelling through the quebrada de humahuaca valley the four teams arrived in the rarefied atmosphere of tilcara at almost the same time they were first directed to the market and then to the checkpoint at the las marias hotel behind the nuestra señora del rosario church foot race ensued between kola

dwindling funds and the uncertainty of which country was more expensive they were faced with choice of where and when to cross the planet third longest land border kola mary ellen decided to cross into chile at the nearest border point paso de jama and used of their remaining funds on taxi to san pedro de atacama they briefly stopped at salinas grandes to marvel at the salt flats before making their way to the elqui valley to top up funds gardening at campsite with almost three times the funds as kola mary ellen and twice as much as the other two teams jeff freddy backtracked to san salvador de jujuy and planned for hour bus journey to mendoza kelly jeremy and scott sam also chose this route rather than wait for the bus kelly jeremy made rare budgetary error by splashing out on taxi for the initial part of the journey which cost five times as much as public transport having gained absolutely no advantage they were reunited with jeff freddy less than minutes later at the bus terminal in san salvador de jujuy where they were joined by scott sam not long after and so it was that three teams found themselves in each other company for the long journey south arriving in mendoza day later the three teams finally parted ways heading in different directions jeff freddy took some time out to rest and recuperate at the nearby thermal springs in chacheuta but having missed the bus back to the city they had to hitch lift from some passing motorists who advised them it would be faster to reach frutillar via santiago scott sam had already decided on this course of action and were making good progress along the paso internacional los libertadores towards the capital santiago despite the easter holiday traffic meanwhile kelly jeremy pressed on deeper into southern argentina but the bus to neuquén broke down jeopardising their onward connection to san carlos de bariloche they needn have worried though as the onward bus through patagonia was also several hours late but on arrival in san carlos de bariloche the border crossing had shut for the night necessitating an overnight stay with funds almost exhausted scott sam took job with completo vendor before spending some on cable car ride up san cristóbal hill they then caught bus to frutillar just as kola mary ellen arrived into the capital to catch their onward connection next morning having found themselves diverted to rancagua jeff freddy caught southbound bus to concepción when scott sam and kola mary ellen arrived in frutillar they were first directed to the teatro del lago and then instructed to make their way further to ensenada kola mary ellen took taxi with what little remained of their funds whilst scott sam opted for boat across lake llanquihue here they were told to head to the base station at the foot of the osorno volcano having taken another taxi when the two teams arrived they found themselves without sufficient money for the chairlift to the finish point marked by chilean flag the race ended on day with scott sam finishing in first place kola mary ellen arrived second two hours and twenty minutes later it was the following day before the two remaining teams

gallant died on october writing according to david lonergan gallant work is inseparable from the emergence of acadian literature his children stories and novels are the most popular in acadian literature with total of copies sold by according to the dictionnaire des auteurs de langue française en amérique du nord gallant work focuses on the soul and life of his homeland acadia his interest in history stems from his search for his origins and his desire to better understand contemporary acadia his works are often the fruit of desire for renewal in acadian literature ti jean is the first collection of stories that is not purely ethnological été insulaire is the first collection of poetry that does not limit itself to identity and le chant des grenouilles is one of the first psychological novels in with the publication of tite jeanne he renewed his own work as this female character acts as counterweight to the male character of ti jean however the publication of gallant tales helped to make traditional stories more accessible ti jean contes acadiens statue of till espiègle another name given to ti jean in gallant published ti jean contes acadiens with éditions acadie while inspired by acadian folklore this collection of tales has universal appeal in fact it an acadian version of very common tale found under that name in quebec louisiana and the west indies as well as under the name till espiègle in germany and ian beg in scotland aimed at ten to fourteen year olds it was the first in series of publications centered on the eponymous character an honest and courageous boy who sets off on adventures to save princesses in danger and fight evil beings in acadian folklore several tales feature character usually called ti jean hired by king to perform various tasks making him standard tale at to in the aarne thompson classification in the acadian version the king replaces the character of the stupid ogre found in other cultures ti jean is also the main character in the tale le fin voleur standard tale at one of the most popular in acadian folklore in which he accomplishes daring thefts the author claims to have been inspired by the liveliness of honoré saint pierre texts in adapting these tales he doesn lapse into the picturesque like many other storytellers and uses simple language and neutral writing little gray according to alain masson contrasting with the mischievous character of the main character in acadian french there is no oral negation ne pas but the author uses it because he decides not to recreate oral discourse as is often the case in storytelling he does however use superlatives the tales are written in the simple past tense common in acadian stories rather than the compound past tense usually used in acadian fictions of the period there are no acadianisms or anglicisms alain masson does note however the use of the word piastre and dollar thus constituting slip of the tongue the simplicity of the language does however enhance the structure of the tale itself and brings us closer to the character functions theorized by russian author vladimir propp who determined that all tales have the same basic structure comprising seven types of characters and functions corresponding to the breakdown of the narrative in fact acadian tales are similar to european tales in structure but differ in detail daniel long even compares ti jean tales to the odyssey the sea is omnipresent characteristic feature of acadian culture another example of acadian influence is the fact that the king is always rich farmer ti jean is marvelous tale as evidenced by the magical machines and the fact that all the animals are endowed with powers ti jean has no powers but he uses magical objects the tales are inspired by oral tradition often beginning with transgressed impediment as when ti jean goes off on an adventure of his own free will to help family member the tales are not organized haphazardly but according to pedagogical even initiatory order the author uses the traditional structure of characters kings sorcerers and princesses and the triple repetition of narrative elements the last tale la quarantième chambre et les quatre murs the fortieth chamber and the four walls may allude to ti jean four journeys which in fact include three stages two returns to his parents home one missing from the story and three safe arrivals thus repeating the triple repetition what more the wicked baron finds the fourth wall daubed the fourth in the collection is thus different marking the end of the story all the women described except the witches are princesses and ti jean seduces several of them in the course of the story he is driven more by desire than love as demonstrated by his description of the discovery of the naked princess in the last tale for him however family values outweigh love values he marries in the merlin tale but finds it harder to win recognition from the king the father figure than he does his daughter hand in marriage he even declares that he rather join his parents than marry in fact ti jean is attached to childish values and has many scruples he is very attached to old men especially sorcerers and fairies who give him gifts of magical objects ti jean contes acadiens sold copies before record for an acadian children book new edition was published in the collection is included in the curriculum of some acadian schools gallant published second collection ti jean le fort in miscellaneous texts working with marielle boudreau gallant completes la cuisine traditionnelle en acadie in book of recipes it was the first published work on the subject and the most comprehensive to date according to david lonergan it is probably the best selling book ever published in acadia le pays acadie published in is text and photo album about acadians their environment economy and leisure activities it also summarizes the history of acadia while situating it in the contemporary political and linguistic context according to jean royer the book is not faked and natania étienne believes it goes beyond the picturesque david lonergan disagrees considering it more like tourist guide however according to michael nowlan the author demonstrates the contribution of the acadians despite their rejection throughout history été insulaire is the only collection of poetry completed by gallant in set in greece its theme is the imprint of wounded mad love in another first for acadian literature gallant used his photographs to embellish caprice la campagne and caprice en hiver collections inspired by his cat caprice both volumes have been translated into english and the author has promised sequel in gallant and ginette gould completed portrait écrivain biographical dictionary of eighty three acadian authors with excerpts from their works this is the first dictionary of acadian authors and was reference work in the but is now obsolete as the authors themselves admit his novel le chant des grenouilles won him the prix france acadie in it tells the story of michel twenty two year old man suffering from an incurable disease who decides to live out his last years to the full in the société historique acadienne published new edition of dière de dièreville account of his travels in acadia from to with an introduction and annotations by melvin gallant this text while not very original is according to john dickinson very perceptive account of acadia at the turn of the eighteenth century his novel le complexe évangéline completed in updates the évangéline myth by attempting to find an end to it the quest of nathalie the heroine is above all metaphor for the affirmation of modernity the poem evangeline though written by american henry longfellow had fundamental influence on acadian culture and renaissance in the th century gallant is the first author to be published by éditions de la francophonie lending credibility to the house the author began new series of three collections tite jeanne in the author wanted to explore the traditional tale with female character they are in fact retellings of ti jean with the same themes but with the prince playing the role of the princess in ti jean david lornergan considers the best of the series to be tite jeanne et le prince igor the third collection since then his tales have been published by bouton or acadie with the exception of patrick internaute published in by chenelière éducation in he wrote the tale cendrillouse cendrillon acadienne in the volume cendrillon de quatre continents cendrillouse or souillon is the name given to cinderella in acadia new version of ti jean éditions acadie closed its doors in creating shortage of the two ti jean collections in response to popular demand the stories were republished by bouton or acadie under the titles ti jean le brave ti jean le rusé ti jean intrépide and ti jean tête or the author uses the original tales with few modifications and adds new texts ti jean le rusé won him the hackmattack prize in ti jean le brave comprises five stories according to daniel marchildon the best are bonnet rouge and belle aurore soleil in which ti jean goes on quest to find characters he also feels that le violon du géant and le géant qui devvorait des jeunes filles contain too many elements in too few pages he does however feel that the author uses colorful imagery and precise vocabulary yves cormier calls it beautiful collection the tales in ti jean intrépide are longer than those in ti jean contes acadiens with more secondary events weighing down the text according to daniel long ti jean intrépide suffers from lack of narrative rigor and an overly neutral style probably caused by hasty writing leading to abrupt endings omissions and incomplete descriptions nevertheless the presentation of these collections remains accessible although michel duguay illustrations could have been better reproduced according to daniel long and daniel marchildon ti jean tête or comprises five stories according to michèle leblanc they have abrupt endings which may discourage some readers le métis de beaubassin and la conquête de île saint jean map of beaubassin the setting for the novel le métis de beaubassin in gallant published le métis de beaubassin which he considers his best work this novel the result of three years of meticulous research explores the history of the village of beaubassin founded in its main character is the author ancestor michel haché dit gallant who was the right hand man of seigneur michel leneuf de la vallière and of beaubassin the novel ends in when the main character tired of being pursued by the english travels with his family to île saint jean now prince edward island gallant novel unveils less well known aspects of acadian life including power struggles everyday challenges dike maintenance witchcraft accusations and conflicts with the english this is one of the few published accounts of beaubassin one of the three main towns in historic acadia along with port royal and grand pré the novel is praised by georges arsenault prince edward island leading acadian historian

virginia thinking about how the different parts of the song would fit together which contrasted with his songwriting process for previous car seat headrest projects the writing process for beach life in death also influenced his songwriting process for the rest of the songs on twin fantasy saying wasn thinking about music unless was literally working on it planning out beach life in death and working on it was definitely where the palette of the album took place where it was going to be this sort of carefully crafted thing that reflected larger plan not just collection of songs during the writing and recording of twin fantasy toledo released demos and snippets of the album songs on his tumblr including beach life in death beach life in death was first officially released on november on

records and completing their tenth studio album teens of denial sessions for the re recording of twin fantasy began in mid and finished in mid the re recording of beach life in death was surprise released on december causing much speculation that complete re recording of twin fantasy would be released soon few weeks later an amazon listing would confirm the project toledo later confirmed that nervous young inhumans was intended to be the lead single however since matador wanted to wait until january to announce the album he asked if he could release the new beach life in death with no prior announcement or explanation the cover art for the single was drawn by hojin stella jung who also did the cd booklet art for twin fantasy face to face composition beach life in death is an indie rock song split into three distinct parts which is shown in the lyric booklets for both versions of twin fantasy the first and third parts are highly energetic and increase in energy while the second part has slower tempo and is quieter the song features many lyrical motifs that appear throughout the song and in each part such as the ocean washed over your grave and last night dreamed he was trying to kill you woke up and was trying to kill you lyrically the and versions of the song are very similar with the most major lyrical difference being in the second part which replaces verse about aubrey beardsley art with lines that toledo wrote for his cover of ivy by frank ocean reception version steve hyden of uproxx while writing guide to all car seat headrest projects described the track as the most stunning work twin fantasy had to offer moreover they described it as harrowing psychodrama that recalls how the narrator pretended to be drunk when came out to my friends before exploring the fantasies he now has about murdering his boyfriend overall they noted that the track long exploratory song composed of epic narratives and multiple musical movements would become staple of toledo sound in the future version the re recording received acclaim from critics and the public sasha geffen of pitchfork praised the single stating that instead of smoothing over the original it instead reinvigorates it elaborating they state that the track hits all the same itchy unnerved points that toledo usually favors in his sprawling rock guitar they also state that the track is split into three unique sections like matryoshka doll of rock tropes lyrically they state that it oscillated between the mundanities of staying alive eating sleeping working eating again and the jitters of negotiating queer identity and relationship overall they state that in beach life in death toledo embodies making your skin crawl with the kind of unhinged ferocity that only fits inside three songs wrapped into one the club was also favorable to the re recording stating that toledo fiery energy remains intact describing the track as jaw dropping series of gear shifts collin brennan of consequence believed beach life in death to be the staple highlight of twin fantasy face to face they stated that the track finds the young songwriter grappling with queer identity amidst loose three part structure that provides just enough support to withstand storm of guitar solos quasi spoken monologues and verses collapsing into bridges collapsing into codas overall believing it to be breathtaking composition that demands multiple listens and rewards in each turn writing for the guardian michael hann believed the track showcased toledo trying to unpack his confusion and bitterness and resentment with swoops into devastating clarity hannah vettese of record collector used beach life in death as an example of how toledo lyrics have become far clearer in the mix elaborating by stating his ability to capture angst fury depression and joy of human life tom brewster of the edge described beach life in death as lyrically being cripplingly introspective with detailed lyrics that pick apart both unrequited love and the terrors of an increasingly modern age with charmingly awkward flourish they described the track as evolving from bedroom rock to an anthemic ballad of teenage confusion he also complemented the guitar work of ethan ives describing them as sounding strained and squealing live performances and covers beach life in death has been staple of the band setlist with the song often closing their live performances it is featured as the last track on commit yourself completely and the second to last track on faces from the masquerade the band two live albums

narrator who represents an alter ego of his author here it is the poet georg düsterhenn who like schmidt comes from hamburg hamm has lower silesian lausitz roots is an atheist and spent second world war as typing pool soldier in norway düsterhenn youthful works are attributed to schmidt verse poem about the persian explorer sataspes as well as the surviving pharos oder von der macht der dichter and like schmidt even in his more mature years düsterhenn could not get woman out of his head whom he fancied as grammar school pupil but never dared to speak to in caliban über setebos she is called fiete methe for schmidt it was the görlitz pupil hanne wulff who was the model for numerous girl or woman characters in schmidt work the germanist sabine kyora therefore believes that the first person narrator in caliban über setebos is virtually identical to its author as wolfgang albrecht shows there are striking differences between the two unlike all of schmidt other protagonists düsterhenn is small and slight he is wealthy despises the enlightenment and as hit song writer is not an author to be taken seriously but an opportunistic trivial writer jörg drews points out that schmidt wrote himself in the third person in the text düsterhenn recalls fellow writer dagegen schmidt who drew his meagre living from the character role of the good left man but because he refused to meet the demands of his audience would never make it to prosperity düsterhenn is the result of lengthy thought experiment about what would happen if he gave up his literary pretensions and wrote in more marketable way action georg düsterhenn travels by bus to the village of schadewalde which is supposed to be located in the border zone of lower saxony there he wants to meet his childhood crush fiete methe again in order to decisively irresistibly make himself schmaltzy for volume of poetry that will be an economic failure and thus reduce his taxable income during an evening walk he observes children running with lanterns meets the holocaust survivor levy who is on his way in his car to stock the condom machines in the area and observes the sexual intercourse between the inn waitress rieke and the farmhand in the village inn he discovers an old jug which he buys from the innkeeper tulp with swiss gold francs he then spends local round of brandy düsterhenn realizes that rieke is actually the fiete he is looking for and asks her to show him to his room however he does not dare to reveal himself to her and since he has potency problems masturbation also fails düsterhenn escapes from the inn at night and observes lesbian group sex in the barn between four hunters whom he had already met at the bus stop and in the inn sneeze gives him away and he is pursued by the four women and the innkeeper dog until he is rescued by the jewish condom salesman in his car shape structure the story is divided into nine parts each of which bears the name of one of the nine muses as its title these fit in one way or another with the content of the story thus the evening walk through the village is headed urania the muse of stargazing melpomene the muse of tragedy stands above düsterhenn disappointing and disappointing encounter with fiete rieke often however the area of responsibility of the muse mentioned is also in an ironic relationship to the events the lesbian orgy is found in the terpsichore chapter the muse of reigentanz the burlesque escape at the end in the thalia chapter the muse of comedy which in ancient understanding is defined by its happy end the rough sex act between fiete rieke and the house servant in the chapter erato who was responsible for rather tender love poetry the text is preceded by motto which parodies in phonetic english an epigram dedicated to herodotus from the anthologia graeca whose historical work is divided into nine books named after the muses style for long stretches the text reflects the inner monologue düsterhenn ruminations his memories and associations of what he sees hears and experiences in doing so he usually comments on the material landscape environment more lovingly than on his fellow human beings for whom he often finds only disillusioning mocking or even resentment laden words schmidt consistently ignores the rules of orthography not only is the respective dialect of the characters imitated but the chosen spelling exhausts the sound and meaning possibilities of word frequently quotations are interspersed in the text sometimes overtly sometimes covertly which sometimes originate from middle high german english or the old languages this results in numerous opportunities for puns punchlines and surprising secondary meanings schmidt himself wrote to the literary scholar jörg drews on september the deliberate polysemy of his language has its origins in schmidt etymology theory which was fed by his encounter with psychoanalysis sigmund freud according to this theory the unconscious expresses itself linguistically in ambiguities wordplay assonance etc in order to simultaneously convey mostly sexual meanings in addition to the manifest level of meaning in order to master this language however the speaker must have attained certain age impotence that allows him to be at least partially free of the drives of the id which he can thus neither repress nor sublimation but rather allow to play out in controlled manner one can therefore now understand oneself with this caliban schmidt later formulated in zettel traum the stories in the volume kühe in halbtrauer and in particular caliban über setebos can thus be understood as attempts to apply this theory to his own literary work reference texts as the literary scholar friedhelm rathjen notes caliban over setebos seems disintegrated it is not immediately clear to the reader what sense the various elements of the plot make the reason for this is that the intertextuality narrative is linked to several other texts without this link being explicitly reflected in the text only when these links are discovered and made explicit can the levels of meaning of caliban über setebos be deciphered robert browning the title of the story quotes caliban upon setebos or natural theology in the island the title of poem by the english poet robert browning published in in it browning has the fierce ugly caliban from shakespeare the tempest to reflect on setebos his god also mentioned in shakespeare he imagines him to be arbitrary malicious and vengeful projecting these qualities from himself onto the deity projection psychoanalysis this poem is alluded to in the text of the story when düsterhenn reflects on what he considers to be the inferior quality of the universe but most of it was pretty stupid of course there were some good parts in the universe now and then but the majority of sete boss products were fusch work in this sense the title stands for radical negation of theodicy schmidt also uses the figure of setebo in two essays written around the same time to allude to the flawed nature of creation an evil god who does not care about the suffering of his creatures was already theme in his story leviathan and in the title nobodaddy kinder under which his short novel brand haide aus dem leben eines fauns and schwarze spiegel were published as trilogy in nobodaddy portmanteau of english nobody no one and daddy papa was term used by the poet william blake for god the fact that düsterhenn accuses his parents of having brought such mooncalf into the world can be understood as an implied identification with caliban as caliban is apostrophized as mooncalf in shakespeare tempest schmidt took the concept of an evil demiurge from late antique gnosis to which düsterhenn disgust for everything corporeal and his refusal to procreate also refer orpheus orpheus leading eurydice from the underworld oil painting by jean baptiste camille corot caliban over setebos is replica of the ancient myth of orpheus the latter travels to the underworld to bring his wife eurydice who died young back to life düsterhenn travels to schadewalde the place name which is actually silesian alludes to the shadows as which the dead lived on in the ancient imagination as well as to the classical philologist and homer translator wolfgang schadewaldt instead of lyre he poet singer always carries the peregrinus syntax rhyming lexicon of the th century green pale his of the face the fact that the journey means trip to hades is hinted at in the very first pages of the story the place name schadewalde contains hades anagramatically in the sign for the bus stop düsterhenn green pale of the face catches the eye the fare is an obolus this coin was given to the dead to pay the ferryman charon for his crossing of the styx the kötelbeck small stream at the entrance to the village has stügisch effect and der erste schiffer himself makes an appearance in the form of man urinating by the wayside in dieser art ist die erzählung dicht durchsetzt mit anspielungen auf den mythos the names of the characters also refer to the orpheus legend düsterhenn first name alludes to virgil georgica in whose fourth book it is told the fact that düsterhenn who despised the peasants was given the first name georg ancient greek for peasant is side point the short form orje is homonymous with orgy as celebrated by the maenads the murderesses of orpheus orje also refers to them phonetically just as rieke refers to eurydice the relationship between the two is changed by schmidt however because in caliban über setebos it is not the man who leads the woman but vice versa namely up narrow staircase to düsterhenn room in the inn and it is not he who looks around at her but she at him if you read the name of the innkeeper tulp backwards the god of the dead pluto comes out at the same time he also stands for the god dionysus because he serves intoxicating drinks and is addressed by the slayers as liber pater the interpretatio romana of dionysus he calls his wife who corresponds to the ancient persephone olsche by changing the syllables you get sheol the name of the underworld used in the tanakh tulp dog is called kirby which sounds like diminutive of kerberos the hound of hell heracles makes his appearance as stablehand since he mucked out the augean stable and the very large egg that he places on the dung heap during post coital bowel evacuation is reminiscent of the world egg of the orphic hymn the lesbians who hunt düsterhenn have their counterpart in the maenads who are said to have literally torn orpheus to pieces schmidt describes the dildo used in their orgy as thyrsos at the same time they are depicted as erinnyes which is shown by the names alex alekto and meg megaira as well as the portmanteau word jägerynnien levy who chauffeurs düsterhenn on his escape from the village is portrayed as jew bernd rauschenbach recognizes in him portrait of schmidt jewish brother in law rudy kiesler who fled to the usa with his wife from the national socialists in ralf georg czapla interprets the figure via the associations hebrew and hebron as an allusion to hebros the river into which the maenads threw orpheus head still singing he was driven to the beach on the island of lesbos which is why the story ends with düsterhenn reflection in the end only the head of decent person remains alive schmidt not only uses the ancient orpheus myth however but also its receptions in the th and th centuries thus the condom representative levy recalls ludovic halévy the librettist of jacques offenbach operetta orpheus in the underworld from rainer maria rilke solemn sonnets to orpheus written in are quoted and comically reinterpreted above all in faecal language or obscene passages for example in the description of the sex act between rieke fiete and the house servant sonnets iv the unicorn vii between the streaming poles of feeling fingers and xvii see the machine how it rolls and avenges itself and disfigures and weakens us in schmidt him disfigured weakened are quoted there stefan jurczyk also recognizes references in the story to the ancient myths of pentheus and actaion who were torn apart by maenads and dogs respectively after watching scenes that were forbidden to the male eye james joyce schmidt adopted the poetological principle of basing narrative set in the present on an ancient myth which is contrasted and satirized by the sometimes profane or burlesque content from his role model james joyce in his ulysses published in single day of the dublin advertiser leopold bloom on the backdrop of homer odyssey homer joyce himself is mentioned twice by name in caliban over setebos once for his alleged ability to reconstruct family history from their dirty laundry then düsterhenn imagines an encounter with the man who died in paraphrasing the thought of his own death the idea of being allowed to serve posthumously as the great irishman warden in kind of poetry olympus reappears in the final escape scene only instead of joyce it says the high name similar to the jewish ban on pronouncing the god name according to jörg drews this does not refer to joyce but to sigmund freud whom schmidt had recently discovered for himself in caliban über setebos reverence is paid to him among other things with reminiscence of reader of friedrich rückert supposedly erotic poem der ehebrecher in reality the poem is called the cup of honor and contains no sexual content whatsoever classic freudian blunder on the other hand the story teems with allusions to freud essay character and analeroticism which schmidt had read shortly before writing it echoes of ulysses itself can be found in two or three places cyclops chapter in which bloom narrowly escapes from violent nationalist is reminiscent of düsterhenn escape from the lesbians as is bloom escape from the brothel in circe chapter bloom masturbation in nausikaa chapter has parallels with düsterhenn voyeurism in the barn the textual references to finnegans wake and its reference texts are clearer especially to the opening chapter of the second book the mime of mick nick and the maggies from which schmidt takes several allusions and puns at the plot level the chapter is about two boys who play riddles with girls outside their parents pub in the evening and are called in motifs that are echoed in schmidt work in tulp pub and the children evening lantern walk joyce uses the biblical myth of jacob and esau as reference text to which schmidt also refers as sow in her hide through the continuous hunting motif which refers to esau as well as through the of düsterhenn as trickster which makes him comparable to the biblical jacob the reference becomes even clearer in the ballad tam shanter by robert burns from which joyce borrows from and which schmidt also alludes to in it the protagonist observes witches sabbath at which he is particularly struck by witch in an overly short petticoat the proverbial cutty sark the witches discover him and he narrowly manages to escape them although his horse meg loses its tail in the process the girls taking part in the game the maggies and the widow megrievy mentioned in the same chapter have the same name in joyce work and schmidt calls one of the four lesbians by this name in the prose version of the saga burns emphasizes tam mistake of having turned around after the light of the witches feast the motif of turning around of returning of unsuccessful repetition is also central to orpheus and to caliban over setebos further reference levels egyptian mythology werner schwarze discovers in caliban über setebos not only allusions to classical ancient mythology but also to that of the egyptians thus the goddess of death hathor can be recognized as well as isis who already played role in the story kundian harness also contained in the volume cows in semi mourning or the creator god ptah this interpretation is doubted by stefan jurczyk who does not consider schwarze evidence often only word components or assonances to be viable karl may karl may on whose texts schmidt had tested his etymological theory sitara und der weg dorthin published in the year caliban über setebos was written receives covert citation when düsterhenn kitschy amateurish poetry is presented in the urania chapter here the poet sits by the wayside in the moonlight and struggling with the meter composes verses that fit his situation it was in the forest the trees were all asleep in wahrheit handelt es sich um den anfang von mays entstandenem gedicht des waldes seele jörg drews believes that this cryptomnetic theft of intellectual property düsterhenn should also be characterized as hermes the god of thieves wilhelm busch rieke mistelfink and her friend the servant krischan mistreat the poet wilhelm busch balduin bählamm the thwarted poet caliban über setebos also has echoes of wilhelm busch picture story balduin bählamm der verhinderte dichter from here too poet seeks inspiration for further creative work in the countryside here too an approach to rieke who is in relationship with farmhand fails here too the poet fails in burlesque manner both erotically and poetically thorne smith friedhelm rathjen recognizes several allusions in caliban over setebos to the novel the night life of the gods by the american popular writer thorne smith in this novel published in the protagonist befriends the megaera who can not only petrify living creatures but also bring statues to life together they bring the images of the roman gods in new york metropolitan museum of art to life and experience number of adventures with them according to rathjen it is not only the name meg megäre that suggests schmidt use but also the theme of the lifeless almost petrified people that düsterhenn encounters in schadewalde not least rieke whose broad face he describes as lifeless cast iron politicians of the federal republic of germany according to the germanist rudi schweikert the name düsterhenn refers to the conservative catholic cdu politician adolf süsterhenn from rhineland palatinate schmidt had moved from this federal state to the more liberal hesse in after his short novel seelandschaft mit pocahontas had earned him criminal proceedings for blasphemy and distribution of lewd writings süsterhenn was president of the rhineland palatinate higher administrative court during this time and was also regarded as strict moralizer and guardian of morals in the following period the fact that the protagonist of story teeming with crude descriptions of sexual acts almost had the same name seemed like extreme back stabbing according to the motto now after the pocahontas affair more than ever further commentaries on the politics of the federal republic of germany can be found in connection with the television program running in tulp parlour this is about the debate about the adenauer succession which was current at the time of writing the question of what brentano highlighted in small capitals might love is an allusion to the rumors about the cdu politician homosexuality in keeping with the themes of the story in which not only female homosexuality plays role but also in the relationship between düsterhenn and levy hauptsache er ss nich direkt schwul latently masculine as well for example when düsterhenn jumps into the open back of levy car at the end interpretations robert wohlleben assumes that schmidt wrote caliban über setebos as model for his readers in order to make clear how his etymological texts should be read in kaff auch mare crisium from he had worked with text foils for the first time in joycian manner namely with the nibelungensage and the myth of el cid the non participation of the readership exceeded the boldest expectations by so obviously basing his düsterhenn story on the orpheus myth schmidt wanted to educate his readers to read in multiple dimensions as preliminary exercise to zettel dream jörg drews sees the story as paradigmatic for schmidt turn towards pessimistic world view in which sex and greed rule the world unchangingly it went hand in hand with work on myth in the sense of hans blumenberg with constant retelling of the same old story the aspect that schmidt uses to make this mythical narrative current and relevant to the present is freud psychoanalysis at the plot level of the mythical tale caliban über setebos the protagonist frees himself from at least one bond namely sexuality by fleeing from schadewalde stefan jurczyk also interprets the narrative as work on myth in ever new reflections basic anthropological problems such as the relationship between eros and death or the male fear of women are allegorically circled this polysemantic procedure collides with schmidt depth psychological etymological theory which attempts to reduce everything to single meaning namely the sex drive in the narrative however this proves to be just another symbolic world among many with which the individual illustrates the otherwise mute meaningless and irrational reality schmidt biographer wolfgang martynkewicz assumes that schmidt aim with caliban über setebos was to have fun juggling with the findings of popular scientific psychoanalysis and with set pieces of mythological material on january schmidt explained in letter to his editor ernst krawehl why he no longer wanted to emphasize the mythological parts of the story typographically as originally planned fucking myth people should have fun ralf georg czapla understands caliban über setebos and the other nine prose pieces from the volume kühe in halbtrauer as attempts at the newly developed prose form traum which schmidt had announced in in his berechnungen ii but had not realized in the figure of the impotent trivial and money hungry interpreted anal fixation düsterhenn the writer schmidt and his attitude to his bread work are reflected in sharp self criticism in the dream logic of the narrative düsterhenn as an id is to be equated with the wild ugly caliban who rails against setebos his superego which appears in the narrative in the form of european high culture influenced by antiquity it is de idealized trivialized vulgarized and ridiculed at every opportunity joyce is presented as the new ideal as whose cupbearer and servant the dreaming self imagines itself to be marius fränzel places the underlying orpheus myth at the center of his interpretation according to him the story is about monomaniacal loner on journey into the past but he himself is not clear about its deeper motivation düsterhenn is deluded man peter habermehl on the other hand sees in caliban über setebos the story of liberation both in sexual and poetological terms the impotence that has become apparent allows düsterhenn distanced observant attitude towards sexuality in the sense of the etymological theory this is the meaning of voyeurism in the terpsichore chapter he is no longer at the mercy of his urges at the end of the plot he describes himself as sädder änd veiser männ this is quote from samuel coleridge ballad the rime of the ancient mariner at the same time düsterhenn also freed himself from poetry he lost his rhyming lexicon during his escape so that in future he could depict in prose what had previously been repressed describe the world realistically and without kitsch as what he was convinced it was uni sive perversum senseless fusch werk as prose writer he would then be able to create superior world because it is orderly and saved in its humor expenditure caliban over setebos is included in the following works arno schmidt kühe in halbtrauer stahlberg verlag

human rights in kosovo has been controversial subject due to the country history of ethnic tension and its struggle for independence this was highlighted during the onset of the kosovo war and the subsequent intervention of the north atlantic treaty organization nato particularly this war and the other conflicts in the balkans were the focus of the european human rights instruments such as the council of europe the osce and the european union after it achieved independence in kosovo has posted several milestones in upholding and the protection of human rights ethnic conflict kosovo has multiple ethnic minorities that include the serb kosovar albanian roma turk muslim slav and other minorities the war that transpired from to was the third conflict involving the former yugoslavia and came after the wars in bosnia and croatia all of these were orchestrated by the serbian strongman slobodan milosevic the leader of serbia and montenegro federal republic of yugoslavia which controlled kosovo as province before the war milosevic campaign promise to defend the serbs in kosovo catapulted him to power the serbs have strong emotional ties to kosovo as they consider the region as the cradle of their nation before milosevic regime kosovo enjoyed an autonomous status that gave ethnic albanians rights and this was guaranteed by the yugoslav constitution when milosevic finally became president of serbia he terminated kosovo special status and suppressed the albanian language and culture these led to the emergence of non violent opposition and the rise of parallel state structures such as the democratic league of kosovo ldk this also led to the establishment on the kosovo liberation army kla an ethnic albanian separatist militia that aimed to liberate kosovo by serbian authorities began campaign against albanians as part of its crackdown of kla and its increasingly aggressive and violent guerilla campaigns two years later the serbian authorities had forcibly displaced thousands of predominantly muslim kosovar albanians who constituted the majority of the province population this was carried out in response to the uprising by the insurgent nationalist group speaking before the un security council then un secretary general kofi annan reported fighting in kosovo has resulted in mass displacement of civilian populations the extensive destruction of villages and means of livelihood and the deep trauma and despair of displaced populations many of the villages have been destroyed by shelling and burning following operations conducted by federal and serbian government forces annan cited the use of force and actions of security forces which were carried out for the purpose of terrorizing and subjugating the civilian population in total the war has displaced and cast out nearly one million albanians out of the country on forced marches in addition serbian security forces pursued campaign of terror in communities according to available data from to albanians were killed and percent of the population of kosovo was displaced due to the predominantly muslim albanians constituting the majority of the population of kosovo the international community claimed milosevic campaign was designed to depopulate the province nato launched operation allied force in as response to the ongoing ethnic cleansing and human rights abuses perpetrated by the serbian forces the goal was to compel the milosevic government to cease its actions in kosovo after this was achieved and the establishment of the un mission in kosovo unmik waves of violence against ethnic minorities persisted for instance as authorities were preparing to accommodate the arrival of incoming nato troops the diocesan reports to the serbian orthodox church revealed harrowing retaliatory abuses were still being committed an account covering pristina kosovo for instance stated that wave of unprecedented violence looting murders and abductions spread throughout the province especially in the cities where the main victims were the remaining serbs roma gorani and muslim bosniacs official data confirmed by both serbian authorities and unmik cited that by january there were missing individuals which include serbs muslim roma and ethnic albanians it was reported that unmik officials were baffled and frustrated by the relentless attacks against minorities even after the war and cited one particular problem that the un involvement in kosovo through the unmik lacked legislative support the un security council resolution which established this mission did not have any provision that stipulated the protection of minorities and the promotion of multi ethnicity observers including unmik officials maintained that this lack of explicit commitment to multi ethnic kosovo sent the wrong signals to extremist who perpetrated violence later international response to the ethnic conflict in kosovo addressed the issues of cultural rights this for instance became one of nato strategies during its temporary administration of kosovo to pacify the area and establish path toward long term peace one of the measures that kosovo has taken in response to its history of human rights abuses was the creation of the truth and reconciliation commission this agency is mandated to investigate human rights violations that were committed during the kosovo war organizations were also established to prosecute war criminals an example is hlc which was founded by the serbian sociologist and human rights advocate natasha kandic after the war it opened an office in pristina and worked with government officials victims and witnesses to prosecute war criminals other human rights issues one of the critical human rights concerns in kosovo involves human trafficking in the early the country was viewed as one of the centers of human trafficking in the balkans for instance according to amnesty international trafficked women who came from the poorest countries of europe were sold in transit to clients in western europe such as italy netherlands and the united kingdom aside from the violation of their freedom about percent of these women were denied any form of medical care and the majority were forced into unprotected sex by kosovo has made significant inroads in addressing the human trafficking problem the kosovo police kp now has trafficking in human beings directorate which investigates all trafficking cases through its eight regional units there is also special coordinator assigned within the office of the state prosecutor to handle trafficking cases in the us state department cited persisting human rights related problems such as corruption and impunity on the part of the government of kosovo these abuses also include politically motivated killings other issues involve different forms of abuse and violence as well as the harassment of ethnic minorities it is noted that while authorities have made significant strides in addressing human rights violations and abuses punishment and enforcement of laws sometimes lacked consistency references
